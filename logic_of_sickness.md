# Logic of Sickness & Make-up Policy (MVP)

To address JTBD F3 ("Handle absences without messages") and S2 ("Sense of fairness"), we need a standardized engine. This stops the "can I pay less?" friction.

## 1. The Core Policy: "Credit, Not Cash"
*   **Fundamental Rule:** No cash refunds for student sickness. Only "Make-up Credits."
*   **Why:** Protects Kasia's cashflow (JTBD E1).

## 2. Absence Reporting Rules
| Reporting Time | Status | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **> 4 Hours before** | "Excused Absence" | 1 Make-up Credit issued. |
| **< 4 Hours before** | "Late Cancel" | No credit issued; session lost. |
| **No show** | "Absent" | No credit issued; session lost. |

## 3. The Make-up Credit Engine
*   **Validity:** Credits expire 30 days after the missed class (or at the end of the semester).
*   **Booking:** Parents can use their credit to "Book a spot" in another existing group of the same level (if a spot is available).
*   **Instructor View:** Kasia sees a "Waiting for make-up" list and can manually assign students to groups that have empty spots.

## 4. The "Instructor-Side" Cancellation
*   **Rule:** If the instructor is sick or the school cancels.
*   **Result:** **Automatic Credit** issued to all students. 
*   **Policy Variation:** If Kasia cannot provide a make-up date within 14 days, the credit converts to a **Discount for the next month's invoice.**

## 5. Mid-Semester Joiners (Pro-rating)
*   **Math:** `(Total Classes in Month - Classes Already Passed) * Price Per Class`.
*   **Logic:** The system auto-calculates this the moment the parent clicks "Pay" on the link.

## 🔍 "Bulletproof" Test
- **Does it stop SMS spam?** Yes, because the policy is visible in the enrollment link and enforced by the "Reporting button."
- **Is it fair?** Yes, the 4-hour window is a industry standard that parents respect.
- **Does it solve Cashflow?** Yes, Kasia keeps the money even if the kid is sick.
